# BlockchainDIY

This is a blockchain project started following this guide:
https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/blockchain-development-mega-guide-5a316e6d10df

The aim of this project is to study blockchain technology with a hands-on approach and to try some tests on different
design patterns related to blockchain, especially the ones concerning networking and consensus.

I think it can be a starting point to approach real, such as enterprise, blockchain projects, although I know that
this project is not "ready for production".
